In this tutorial, you'll see how to deploy a documentation website to the internet – for free. This tutorial is intended for anyone new to command line tools, Git, or web deployment. It assumes you have knowledge of:

- Using a computer (files, folders, installing software)
- Using a web browser
- Nothing else – we'll explain everything from scratch

:::tip This might look intimidating
It's not. Every single step is explained in plain English. Thousands of people with zero coding experience have done exactly this. You've got this.
:::

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have seen how to:

- Use the terminal to run commands
- Work with Git (a tool that tracks file changes)
- Deploy a live website with a public URL

## Background

Before we start, let's demystify some terms. You don't need to memorise these – just read them once so nothing feels alien.

| Term | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Terminal** | A text-based way to control your computer. Instead of clicking icons, you type commands. |
| **Git** | A tool that tracks every change to your files. Like "version history" in Google Docs, but more powerful. |
| **GitHub** | A website where people store and share code. Also offers free website hosting. |
| **Repository (repo)** | A project folder that Git tracks. Contains your files plus their entire history. |
| **Clone** | Downloading a repository to your computer. |
| **Commit** | Saving a snapshot of your changes. Unlike regular saving, you can always go back to any commit. |
| **Push** | Uploading your commits to GitHub. |
| **Branch** | A parallel version of your files. You'll use one called `gh-pages` for your website. |

## Before you start

Before you start the tutorial, you should:

- Have a computer (not a phone – you'll need a proper keyboard)
- Set aside 30-45 minutes
- Be patient with yourself

That's it. We'll install everything else together.

:::note Take your time
This isn't a race. If a step takes longer than expected, that's fine. If you need a break, take one. Your progress won't disappear.
:::

## Create a GitHub account

If you already have a GitHub account, skip to [Install the tools](#install-the-tools).

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) in your browser.

2. Click **Sign up**.

3. Follow the prompts to create your account.

4. Verify your email address when GitHub sends you a confirmation.

    <details>
    <summary>Something went wrong?</summary>

    - **Email not arriving?** Check your spam folder. Still nothing? **Click** "Resend verification email" on GitHub.
    - **Username taken?** Try adding numbers or underscores: `yourname_123`
    - **Stuck anywhere?** GitHub has a [detailed signup guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github).

    </details>

## Install the tools

You'll need three tools: Git, Node.js, and Yarn. This is a one-time setup – you'll never do this again.

:::info Set aside 15-20 minutes
Installation involves downloading and waiting. It's not hard, just slow.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>

  ### Open Terminal

  1. Press `Cmd + Space` (Command key next to spacebar, plus Space).

  2. Type "Terminal" and press **Enter**.

    A window with a black or white background opens. This is the terminal. It might look intimidating – that's normal. It's just a text box where you type commands.

  ### Install Homebrew

  Homebrew is a tool that installs other tools.

  1. **Copy** this entire line:

      ```bash
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
      ```

  2. **Paste** it into Terminal (`Cmd + V`) and **press** Enter.

  3. If asked for your password, **type** it and **press** Enter.

      :::info Can't see your password?
      That's intentional – it's a security feature. Your keystrokes are registering, you just can't see them. Type your password and press Enter.
      :::

  4. **Wait** until it finishes (2-5 minutes). You'll see lots of output. The important thing is the last line shows:

      ```
        ==> Installation successful!
      ```

  <details>
  <summary>Something went wrong?</summary>

  - **"Command not found"** → Make sure you copied the entire command, including `/bin/bash` at the start.
  - **Password not working** → Use your Mac login password, not your Apple ID.
  - **Any other error** → Copy the error message and search Google with "homebrew install error" added.
  </details>

  ### Install Git, Node.js, and Yarn

  1. Copy and paste this command, then press **Enter**:

      ```bash
      brew install git node yarn
      ```

  2. Wait until it finishes. You'll see lots of output. The important thing is no red error messages appear.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

  ### Install Git

  1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).

  2. Click the download button.

  3. Run the installer.

  4. Click **Next** on every screen. Don't change any options – the defaults are fine.

  ### Install Node.js

  1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

  2. Click the big green button that says **LTS**.

  3. Run the installer.

  4. Click **Next** on every screen. Defaults are fine.

  ### Open Git Bash

  1. Click the **Start** menu (Windows icon, bottom left).

  2. Type **Git Bash**.

  3. Click on **Git Bash** to open it.

    A window opens that looks like a terminal. This is where you'll type commands.

  ### Install Yarn

  1. Copy and paste this command into Git Bash, then press Enter:

      ```bash
      npm install -g yarn
      ```

  2. Wait until it finishes. You'll see some output. The important thing is no red error messages appear.

      <details>
      <summary>Something went wrong?</summary>

      - **"npm is not recognised"** → Node.js didn't install correctly. Close Git Bash, reinstall Node.js, then reopen Git Bash.
      - **Installer won't run** → Right-click the installer, **select** "Run as administrator".

      </details>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify the installation

Let's make sure everything installed correctly.

1. Run these commands one by one. Copy, paste, press Enter:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

    You'll see output. The important thing is a version number appears:

    ```
    git version 2.42.0
    ```

    If you see `command not found` instead, the installation failed.

2. Run the next command:

    ```bash
    node --version
    ```

    The important thing is a version number appears:

    ```
    v20.10.0
    ```

3. Run the last command:

    ```bash
    yarn --version
    ```

    The important thing is a version number appears:
    ```
    1.22.19
    ```

:::danger If any command failed
Don't continue. Go back and reinstall the failing tool. Continuing with a broken setup causes confusing errors later.

**Stuck?** Ask someone technical for help. Installation issues are the hardest part.
:::

🎉 **Congratulations!** The hard part is over. Seriously. Installing tools is the most frustrating step, and you've done it.

## Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

GitHub doesn't accept passwords for command line operations. You need a "token" instead – think of it as a special password for tools.

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

   Or: Click your profile picture → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**.

2. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**.

3. Fill in the form:
   - Note: **Docusaurus deployment** (or anything you'll recognise)
   - Expiration: **90 days**
   - Scopes: Tick these boxes:
     - **repo** (this selects all sub-items – that's correct)
     - **write:packages**
     - **read:packages**

4. Scroll down and click **Generate token**.

5. Copy the token immediately.

If your token was created successfully, you'll see this:

![Token successfully created](/img/howto/01-token-created.png)

:::warning Copy it NOW
GitHub shows the token once. If you leave this page without copying, you'll have to create a new one.

The token looks like `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. Save it somewhere temporarily – a notes app, a text file, anywhere.
:::

:::caution What NOT to do with your token
- Don't share it with anyone
- Don't post it online
- Don't save it in a public file

**Lost it?** No problem. Delete the old token on GitHub and create a new one. Takes 30 seconds.
:::

## Clone the repository

Now we'll download the project files to your computer.

1. Open your terminal (Terminal on macOS, Git Bash on Windows).

2. Run this command to download the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PhilStollery/github-usaurus.git
    ```

    You'll see output. The important thing is the last lines show:

    ```
    Cloning into 'github-usaurus'...
    ...
    Receiving objects: 100% ... done.
    ```

3. Enter the folder:

    ```bash
    cd github-usaurus
    ```

    (`cd` means "change directory" – it's how you navigate folders in the terminal.)

    :::tip Not sure if it worked?
    Type `ls` and press **Enter** in your terminal. You should see a list of files including `docusaurus.config.ts` and `package.json`. If you see them, you're in the right place.
    :::

<details>
<summary>Something went wrong?</summary>

- **"fatal: repository not found"** → Check the URL for typos.
- **"Permission denied"** → Try a different folder. Run `cd ~` first to go to your home folder, then try cloning again.
- **Folder already exists** → You've cloned it before. Just run `cd github-usaurus` to enter it.

</details>

## Create your own repository

You've downloaded the files, but they're still linked to someone else's project. You need your own copy on GitHub.

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) in your browser.

2. Enter a repository name. Use the same name: `github-usaurus`.

    :::info Naming rules
    - No spaces – use dashes instead
    - Lowercase is conventional
    - Keep it short
    :::

3. Select **Private**.

4. Don't tick any checkboxes. Leave everything empty.

5. Click **Create repository**.

6. Go back to your terminal and run this command:

    ```bash
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/github-usaurus.git
    ```

    :::caution Replace YOUR-USERNAME
    Don't literally type "YOUR-USERNAME". If your GitHub username is "janedoe", the command should be:

    `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/janedoe/github-usaurus.git`
    :::

7. **Upload** the files to your repository:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

8. Git asks for your username and password:

    - **Username:** Your GitHub username
    - **Password:** Paste your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

    You'll see output. The important thing is the last lines show:

    ```
    To https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/github-usaurus.git
    * [new branch]      main -> main
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>Something went wrong?</summary>

    - **"Authentication failed"** → You entered your GitHub password instead of the token. Try again with the token.
    - **"Repository not found"** → Check the URL. Is your username spelled correctly? Did you create the repository?

    </details>

## Configure the site

The website configuration still points to the original author. Let's fix that.

1. Open the project folder in a text editor.

   If you don't have one, download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) – it's free.

2. Open the file called `docusaurus.config.ts`.

3. Find these lines (around lines 8-14):

    ```typescript
    url: 'https://philstollery.github.io',
    baseUrl: '/github-usaurus/',
    organizationName: 'philstollery',
    projectName: 'github-usaurus',
    ```

4. Change them to your values:

    ```typescript title="docusaurus.config.ts" {1-4}
    url: 'https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io',
    baseUrl: '/github-usaurus/',
    organizationName: 'YOUR-USERNAME',
    projectName: 'github-usaurus',
    ```

    Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username. Keep `github-usaurus` as the `baseUrl` and `projectName`.

    :::danger Don't break the syntax
    Only change the text between the quote marks. Don't delete the quotes, commas, or colons.

    | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
    |----------|-----------|
    | `url: https://janedoe.github.io` | `url: 'https://janedoe.github.io',` |
    | `baseUrl: github-usaurus` | `baseUrl: '/github-usaurus/',` |
    :::

5. Save the file (`Cmd + S` on macOS, `Ctrl + S` on Windows).

6. Go back to your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    git add docusaurus.config.ts
    git commit -m "docs: configure site for GitHub Pages deployment"
    git push
    ```

    You'll see output. The important thing is no error messages appear.

## Set up GitHub Pages

GitHub needs to know where to find your published website files.

1. Create a special branch for the website:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b gh-pages
    git push -u origin gh-pages
    git checkout main
    ```

    Don't worry about what "branch" means. Just run the commands. You'll see output after each command – the important thing is no error messages appear.

2. Go to your repository on GitHub (github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/github-usaurus).

3. Click **Settings** (tab near the top, not your profile settings).

4. Click **Pages** in the left sidebar.

5. Under "Source", click the dropdown and select `gh-pages`.

6. Click **Save**.

If configured successfully, your settings will look like this:

![GitHub Pages settings configured](/img/howto/02-pages-configured.png)

<details>
<summary>Can't see gh-pages in the dropdown?</summary>

Refresh the page. GitHub needs a moment to register new branches.

Still not there? Go back to step 1 and run those commands again.

</details>

## Deploy the site

The finish line. Let's build and publish your site.

1. Set some temporary variables:

    ```bash
    export GIT_USER="YOUR-USERNAME"
    export GIT_PASS="YOUR-TOKEN"
    ```

    Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOUR-TOKEN` with the personal access token you created earlier.

2. **Install** project dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

    You'll see lots of output scrolling by. This is normal. The important thing is the last line shows something like:

    ```
    Done in 45.32s.
    ```

3. Deploy:

    ```bash
    yarn deploy
    ```

    Again, lots of output. The important thing is this line appears at the end:

    ```
    Website is live at: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/github-usaurus/
    ```

4. Wait 2-3 minutes. GitHub needs time to process.

5. If everything worked, you'll see your live site:

    ![Your live site in the browser](/img/howto/03-site-live.png)

    :::tip Don't see anything?
    GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes on first deploy. Grab a snack. If it's still not working after 10 minutes, check the troubleshooting section.
    :::

🎉 **You did it!** Your website is live on the internet. Anyone with the URL can see it.

## When something goes wrong

<details>
<summary>yarn deploy fails</summary>

**First:** Read the error message. Somewhere in there is a clue.

| Error contains | Cause | Fix |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| "Authentication failed" | Token expired or wrong scopes | Create a new token with `repo`, `write:packages`, and `read:packages` scopes |
| "src refspec gh-pages" | Branch doesn't exist | Run the `gh-pages` branch commands again |
| "baseUrl" | Configuration mismatch | Check `docusaurus.config.ts` for typos |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Site shows 404 error</summary>

- **Did you wait?** First deploy can take up to 10 minutes.
- **Check the URL.** Is your username spelled correctly?
- **Check Settings → Pages.** Does it say "Your site is live"? Is the source set to `gh-pages`?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Site looks broken (no styling)</summary>

The `baseUrl` in `docusaurus.config.ts` doesn't match your repository name. It must be `/github-usaurus/` with both slashes.

Fix it, save, then run:
```bash
git add docusaurus.config.ts
git commit -m "fix: correct baseUrl"
git push
yarn deploy
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>I'm completely stuck</summary>

1. **Don't panic.** Everything is recoverable.
2. **Don't delete everything.** That's almost never the answer.
3. **Take a break.** Seriously. Fresh eyes help.
4. **Ask for help.** Post in a forum, ask a friend, or ask the person who sent you this task.

</details>

:::caution What NOT to do when stuck
- Don't run random commands from the internet
- Don't delete folders hoping it'll fix things
- Don't start over from scratch (Git has your history – use it)
:::

## Summary

In this tutorial, you've now seen how to:

- Install Git, Node.js, and Yarn on your computer
- Use basic terminal commands
- Create a GitHub repository and personal access token
- Configure Docusaurus for your account
- Deploy a live website to GitHub Pages

You've also learnt something more important: when things go wrong, you can troubleshoot and recover. That's the real skill.

## Next steps

Consider completing some other common tasks:

- Edit content in the `docs/` folder and run `yarn deploy` again
- Learn Markdown basics at [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- Customise your site's appearance in `docusaurus.config.ts`
