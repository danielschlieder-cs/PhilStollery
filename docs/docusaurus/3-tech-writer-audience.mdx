In this tutorial, you'll see how to add, edit, and remove documentation pages in a Docusaurus project. This tutorial is intended for technical writers who manage content but don't manage the build system. It assumes you have knowledge of:

- Writing and editing in Markdown
- Basic file management (creating, saving, and organising files)
- Nothing about Node.js, JavaScript, or build tools – you won't need them

:::tip Your writing skills are the hard part
You already have those. The technical bits here are just button-pushing. Anyone can learn them in an afternoon.
:::

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have seen how to:

- Navigate the project structure
- Add, edit, and remove documentation pages
- Preview your changes locally
- Save and upload your work using Git
- Create a pull request for review

## Background

This project uses a "docs-as-code" approach. Instead of editing in a CMS or wiki, you edit text files directly. These files are written in Markdown – a simple formatting language you likely already know.

The website is built automatically from these files. You don't build it yourself. You just write, save, and submit. DevOps handles the rest.

## Before you start

Before you start the tutorial, you should:

- Have access to the documentation repository (ask your team lead if you don't)
- Have Git installed on your computer
- Have a text editor (VS Code is recommended)

:::note First time using Git?
Git tracks changes to files – like version history in Google Docs, but more powerful. You'll learn the commands you need in this tutorial. You don't need to understand how Git works internally.
:::

### Verify your setup

Open your terminal (Terminal on macOS, Git Bash on Windows) and run:

```bash
git --version
```

| ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
|---------|--------|
| `git version 2.42.0` | `command not found` |

:::danger If Git isn't installed
Ask DevOps to help you install it. Don't proceed without Git – nothing else in this tutorial will work.
:::

## Understand the project structure

You only work in one folder: `docs/`. Everything else is infrastructure that you don't touch.

```
project/
├── docs/           ← YOUR WORKSPACE
│   ├── intro.md
│   ├── guides/
│   └── templates/
├── src/            ← Don't touch
├── static/         ← Don't touch (unless adding images)
├── docusaurus.config.ts  ← Don't touch
└── package.json    ← Don't touch
```

:::caution Your boundaries
**Do:** Edit files in `docs/`

**Don't:** Edit anything outside `docs/` unless specifically asked

If you accidentally edit something outside `docs/`, tell DevOps. They'll fix it. Don't try to undo it yourself.
:::

## Get the project

If you already have the project on your computer, skip to [Start your work session](#start-your-work-session).

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to where you want to store the project:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents
    ```

3. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/docs-repo.git
    ```

4. Go into the folder:

    ```bash
    cd docs-repo
    ```

5. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

    This takes a minute. Wait until it finishes.

<details>
<summary>Something went wrong?</summary>

- **"Repository not found"** → The URL is wrong, or you don't have access. Ask your team lead.
- **"yarn: command not found"** → Yarn isn't installed. Ask DevOps.
- **Other errors** → Copy the error message and send it to DevOps. Don't try to fix it yourself.

</details>

## Start your work session

**Every time** you start working, do this first:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/docs-repo
    ```

2. **Get** the latest version:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull
    ```

This ensures you're working with the latest content. Skipping this step can cause conflicts from other people making changes.

## Create a branch for your work

Never edit directly on `main`. Always create a branch first.

Run:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
```

Replace `your-branch-name` with something descriptive:

| Task | Branch name |
|------|-------------|
| Adding a new guide | `feature/add-deployment-guide` |
| Fixing typos | `fix/typos-in-getting-started` |
| Updating existing content | `update/api-authentication-docs` |

:::tip One branch per task
Working on two unrelated things? Make two branches. It keeps reviews focused.
:::

## Add a new page

1. Navigate to the `docs/` folder in your text editor.

2. Create a new file with a `.md` or `.mdx` extension.

    **Filename rules:**
    | ✅ Correct | ❌ Wrong |
    |-----------|----------|
    | `how-to-configure-alerts.mdx` | `How To Configure Alerts.mdx` |
    | `api-authentication.md` | `apiAuthentication.md` |
    | `setup-guide.mdx` | `setup guide.mdx` |

3. Add frontmatter at the top of the file:

    ```mdx
    ---
    title: How to configure alerts
    ---
    ```

    The title uses sentence case (only first word capitalised).

4. Write your content below the frontmatter.

5. Save the file.

## Edit an existing page

1. Find the file in `docs/`. The filename usually matches the page title.

2. Open it in your text editor.

3. Make your changes.

4. Save.

:::caution What NOT to change
- If you need to rename the file, make sure to update any links to it.
- Don't remove or rename the `title` in frontmatter
- Don't change the file extension
:::

## Remove a page

1. Delete the file from `docs/`.

2. Search the project for the filename to find any links to it.

3. Update or remove those links.

:::warning Don't just delete
Deleting without checking for links creates broken links. Readers get confused, search engines penalise the site. Always check first.
:::

## Preview your changes

You have two options:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="editor" label="In your editor" default>

  VS Code has built-in Markdown preview.

  1. Open a Markdown file.
  2. Press `Cmd + Shift + V` (macOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + V` (Windows).

  Good for checking formatting while writing.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local preview">

  See exactly how it'll look on the live site.

  1. Run in your terminal:

      ```bash
      yarn start
      ```

  2. Wait until it says the site is running at `http://localhost:3000`.

  3. Your browser opens automatically. If not, go to in your browser http://localhost:3000.

  4. Keep the terminal open while you work. The preview updates automatically when you save.

  5. Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal to stop when you're done.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
<summary>Preview not working?</summary>

- **"Command not found"** → You're not in the project folder. Run `cd ~/Documents/docs-repo` first.
- **Errors when starting** → Copy the error and send it to DevOps. This is a build issue, not your problem to solve.
- **Preview not updating** → Save the file. Try a hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R` (macOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows).

</details>

## Save your changes with Git

When you've completed a piece of work, save it to Git.

### Two types of saving

| Action | What it does | When to do it |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Save file** (`Cmd + S` / `Ctrl + S`) | Writes to your computer | Constantly – every few sentences |
| **Commit** (Git command) | Creates a checkpoint in history | When you finish a logical chunk of work |

Saving a file is temporary. Commits are permanent checkpoints you can return to.

### Check what you've changed

```bash
git status
```

This shows which files you've modified, added, or deleted. **Review this list.** If you see files outside `docs/`, something went wrong – ask for help.

### Stage your changes

```bash
git add docs/
```

This tells Git which files to include. Using `docs/` only adds documentation files – a safety measure.

### Commit

```bash
git commit -m "docs: add deployment guide"
```

The message after `-m` describes what you did. Keep it short and specific.

| ✅ Good messages | ❌ Bad messages |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `docs: add troubleshooting section` | `update` |
| `fix: correct typo in setup guide` | `fixed stuff` |
| `docs: remove outdated API reference` | `changes` |

:::tip Commit often
Small, frequent commits are better than one massive commit. Each commit is an "undo point" you can return to.
:::

### Push to GitHub

```bash
git push
```

The first time you push a new branch, Git tells you what to do:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin feature/your-branch-name
```

Copy and run that command. After the first push, `git push` works normally.

<details>
<summary>Push failed?</summary>

- **"Authentication failed"** → You need a personal access token. Ask DevOps to help you set one up.
- **"Rejected... fetch first"** → Someone else pushed changes. Run `git pull`, then try `git push` again.
- **Other errors** → Copy the error and ask DevOps.

</details>

## Create a pull request

Once your work is ready for review:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.

2. You'll see a yellow banner about your branch. Click **Compare & pull request**.

3. Write a brief description of your changes.

4. Assign a reviewer.

5. Click **Create pull request**.

Now wait for feedback. The reviewer might request changes or approve and merge.

## After your work is merged

1. **Switch** back to main:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

2. **Get** the latest version (including your merged work):

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

3. **Delete** your old branch:

    ```bash
    git branch -d feature/your-branch-name
    ```

Start fresh with a new branch for your next task.

## What you do vs. what you don't

| Task | Your job? | Who does it |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Write and edit content | ✅ Yes | You |
| Commit and push changes | ✅ Yes | You |
| Create pull requests | ✅ Yes | You |
| Preview locally | ✅ Yes | You |
| Build the website | ❌ No | Automated |
| Deploy to production | ❌ No | Automated |
| Fix build errors | ❌ No | DevOps |
| Resolve complex Git issues | ❌ No | DevOps |
| Merge to main | ❌ No | Reviewer |

Your scope ends at the pull request. Everything after is automated or someone else's responsibility.

## When something goes wrong

<details>
<summary>I made a mess of my branch</summary>

Your mistakes are isolated. The main documentation is untouched.

To start fresh:
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/my-broken-branch
git checkout -b feature/fresh-start
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>I edited a file outside docs/</summary>

If you haven't committed:
```bash
git checkout -- path/to/file
```

If you have committed, tell DevOps. They'll fix it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I committed to main by accident</summary>

**Stop.** Don't push. Tell DevOps immediately. They'll sort it out.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I don't understand what went wrong</summary>

1. Don't guess
2. Don't run random commands
3. Copy the error message
4. Send it to DevOps
5. Wait

Your documentation is safe. Git doesn't lose things.

</details>

:::tip The nuclear option
Worst case: delete the entire folder and clone fresh. You'll lose uncommitted work, but everything pushed to GitHub is safe.
:::

## Quick reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Get latest | `git checkout main` then `git pull` |
| Start new work | `git checkout -b feature/name` |
| See what changed | `git status` |
| Stage changes | `git add docs/` |
| Commit | `git commit -m "docs: message"` |
| Push | `git push` |
| Preview locally | `yarn start` |
| Stop preview | `Ctrl + C` |

## Summary

In this tutorial, you've now seen how to:

- Navigate the project structure and understand your workspace
- Add, edit, and remove documentation pages
- Preview changes locally or in your editor
- Save your work with Git (stage, commit, and push)
- Create a pull request for review

Remember: if anything technical goes wrong, ask DevOps. Your job is writing great documentation, not debugging build systems.

## Next steps

Consider completing some other common tasks:

- Review the project's style guide
- Learn advanced Markdown formatting for your editor
- Set up VS Code extensions for Markdown editing
