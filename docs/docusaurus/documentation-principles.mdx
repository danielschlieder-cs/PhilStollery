title: My documentation principles
---

## Why I write documentation

I write documentation to enable. Every document I create answers one question: "What can the reader do after reading this that they couldn't do before?"

If the answer is "nothing concrete" – I've written prose, not documentation.

## Audience first

Before I write a single word, I need to know: Who is reading this?

The same topic requires different documents for different readers. A deployment guide for a senior DevOps engineer looks nothing like a deployment guide for a technical writer with no CLI experience. Both are valid. Neither works for the other audience.

I don't start writing until I know who I'm writing for. This isn't bureaucracy. It's step zero.

## My principles

### Enable, don't explain

I'm not writing a textbook. My reader has a task. My job is to help them complete it. I only include background information if it helps the reader succeed.

I constantly ask myself: Does this paragraph help them do the thing? If not, I cut it.

### Don't babel

Every undefined term is friction. Every assumption about prior knowledge is a potential dead end.

If I use a term, I either define it on first use, or I'm certain my audience knows it. There's no middle ground. "They'll figure it out" isn't a strategy I accept.

### Stay focused

External references break flow. Every link is an invitation to leave.

I link only when the reader genuinely needs that information to proceed, and I can't reasonably include it in my document.

"For more information, see..." is often a cop-out. I include what's needed. I skip what isn't.

### Provide exit strategies

Things go wrong. Readers make mistakes. Systems fail.

Every procedural document I write includes:

- What to do when a step fails
- What NOT to do (equally important)
- When to stop and ask for help
- Who to ask

"If this doesn't work, troubleshoot" is useless. "If you see error X, do Y. If you see anything else, contact DevOps with a screenshot" - that's actionable.

### Motivate

Technical documentation can be intimidating. Readers abandon docs when they feel overwhelmed.

I include:

- Reassurance that complexity is manageable
- Clear scope ("this takes 15 minutes")
- Permission to not understand everything
- Acknowledgment that getting stuck is normal

This isn't hand-holding. It's respecting that my reader is human.

### Define boundaries

Readers need to know what's their responsibility and what isn't.

I make explicit:

- What they should do
- What they should never do
- What happens automatically
- Who handles the rest

Ambiguity creates anxiety and mistakes. I eliminate it.

## One topic, multiple documents

A single audience definition doesn't cover all readers. When audiences differ significantly, I write separate documents.

:::tip Example: this assessment
I created three versions of the same deployment guide:

| Version | Audience |
|---------|----------|
| [Default](./1-default-audience.mdx) | Developers, DevOps engineers |
| [Beginner](./2-mobile-only-gen-audience.mdx) | First-time terminal users |
| [Tech writer](./3-tech-writer-audience.mdx) | Writers managing content, not systems |

Same task. Three audiences. Three documents.
:::

Maintaining multiple versions is more work. Serving all audiences with one document is impossible. I choose my trade-off deliberately.

## On AI-assisted writing

I write documentation with AI assistance. In 2025, this is simply how the job works.

My role has shifted:

| Before | Now |
|--------|-----|
| Producing text | Briefing, reviewing, ensuring consistency |
| Typing | Identifying gaps, maintaining voice |
| Writing from scratch | Editing and architecting |

I don't hide this. Teams hiring me should know: I use the tools available. I deliver quality. The method is modern.

## What I deliver

Documentation that:

- ✅ Enables action
- ✅ Knows its audience
- ✅ Stays focused
- ✅ Doesn't babel
- ✅ Provides exit strategies
- ✅ Motivates without patronising
- ✅ Defines boundaries clearly
- ✅ Adapts to different audiences

The measure is simple: Did the reader succeed?
