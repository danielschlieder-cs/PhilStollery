In this tutorial, you'll see how to deploy a Docusaurus website to GitHub Pages. This tutorial is intended for developers and technical users who want to host documentation for free. It assumes you have knowledge of:

- Basic command line usage
- Git fundamentals (clone, commit, and push)
- GitHub account management

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have seen how to:

- Configure Docusaurus for GitHub Pages deployment
- Create a GitHub personal access token with correct scopes
- Set up the `gh-pages` branch for hosting
- Deploy your site using the Docusaurus deploy command

## Background

Docusaurus is a static site generator built for documentation. GitHub Pages offers free hosting for static sites. Together, they provide a zero-cost way to publish professional documentation.

The deployment process builds your Docusaurus site locally and pushes the output to a dedicated branch (`gh-pages`) that GitHub serves as a website.

## Before you start

Before you start the tutorial, you should:

- Install Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Install the Yarn package manager
- Have a GitHub account
- Have Git configured locally with push access

:::note Verify your setup
Run `yarn --version` in your terminal. If you see a version number, you're ready. If not, install Yarn first – the deploy command depends on it.
:::

## Create a personal access token

:::tip Already have a token?
If you've got an existing GitHub personal access token with `repo`, `write:packages`, and `read:packages` scopes, skip to [Clone the repository](#clone-the-repository).
:::

GitHub requires token authentication for command line operations.

1. **Open** GitHub and **click** your profile picture (top right) → **Settings**.

2. **Scroll down** in the left sidebar and **click** **Developer settings**.

3. **Click** **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**.

4. **Click** **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**.

5. **Fill in** the form:
   - **Note:** `Docusaurus deployment`
   - **Expiration:** 90 days
   - **Scopes:** Tick `repo` (all), `write:packages`, and `read:packages`

6. **Click** **Generate token**.

7. **Copy** the token immediately. GitHub only displays it once.

:::caution Token security
**Do:** Store it somewhere safe temporarily.

**Don't:** Commit it to a repository or share it.

**Lost it?** Create a new one. It takes 30 seconds.
:::

## Clone the repository

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhilStollery/github-usaurus.git
   cd github-usaurus
```

2. **Create** a new private repository on GitHub under your account. Leave all checkboxes unticked.

3. **Update** the remote origin to point to your repository:
```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
```

   Git asks for your username and password. Enter your GitHub username. For the password, **paste** your personal access token.

:::info Push failed?
If you see "authentication failed", your token may be missing the `repo` scope. Create a new token with the correct permissions.
:::

## Configure the site

1. **Open** `docusaurus.config.ts` in your text editor.

2. **Update** the following values with your GitHub username and repository name:
```typescript title="docusaurus.config.ts" {2-5}
   const config: Config = {
     url: 'https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io',
     baseUrl: '/YOUR-REPO-NAME/',
     organizationName: 'YOUR-USERNAME',
     projectName: 'YOUR-REPO-NAME',
   };
```

:::danger Common mistake
`baseUrl` must have leading AND trailing slashes: `/your-repo-name/`

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|----------|-----------|
| `your-repo` | `/your-repo/` |
| `/your-repo` | `/your-repo/` |

This causes 90% of "my site looks broken" issues.
:::

3. **Commit** and **push** your changes:
```bash
   git add docusaurus.config.ts
   git commit -m "docs: configure site for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push
```

## Set up GitHub Pages

1. **Create** the `gh-pages` branch and push it:
```bash
   git checkout -b gh-pages
   git push -u origin gh-pages
   git checkout main
```

2. **Navigate** to your repository on GitHub.

3. **Click** **Settings** → **Pages**.

4. **Select** `gh-pages` as the source branch and **click** **Save**.

:::info Branch not visible?
Refresh the page. GitHub needs a moment to register new branches.
:::

## Deploy the site

1. **Set** your environment variables:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS / Linux" default>
```bash
export GIT_USER="YOUR-USERNAME"
export NPM_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows (PowerShell)">
```powershell
$env:GIT_USER="YOUR-USERNAME"
$env:NPM_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. **Install** project dependencies:
```bash
   yarn
```

3. **Run** the deployment command:
```bash
   yarn deploy
```

   This builds your site and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch.

4. **Wait** 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to publish.

5. **Visit** your site at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`.

<summary>Something went wrong?</summary>

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Authentication error | Token expired or wrong scopes | Create new token with `repo` scope |
| `src refspec gh-pages does not match` | Branch doesn't exist | Run `gh-pages` commands again |
| 404 after 10 minutes | Pages not enabled | Check Settings → Pages, verify source is `gh-pages` |
| CSS missing, broken layout | `baseUrl` mismatch | Must be `/exact-repo-name/` with both slashes |

**Still stuck?** Check the [Docusaurus deployment docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment).

Step away for 5 minutes. Fresh eyes solve more bugs than frantic typing.
