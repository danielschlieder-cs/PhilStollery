Hi Phil,

Assessment completed.

**Live site:** https://danielschlieder-cs.github.io/PhilStollery/

**What you'll find:**

I delivered more than the single tutorial requested. The documentation is structured by target audience:

| Document | Audience |
|----------|----------|
| Deploy Docusaurus to GitHub Pages | Developers, DevOps engineers |
| Deploy Docusaurus to GitHub Pages (beginner guide) | First-time terminal users |
| How to edit documentation content | Technical writers managing content only |
| My documentation principles | My approach to writing docs |

Same task, different readers. This reflects how I work: audience first.

**Honest note:** It's been a while since I worked with Docusaurus and GitHub Pages. I had to fumble through some config issues (baseUrl, tokens, gh-pages branch setup) – but that's exactly what the docs are for. By the end, it all clicked again. Rust-free now.

**Side note:** I only found your hidden bug when I actually pushed. The README says `NPM_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` – but `yarn deploy` needs `GIT_PASS`. Took me a failed deploy to figure that one out. ;)

**Fun fact:** I renamed the repo from `github-usaurus` to `PhilStollery`. Regardless of the outcome, this was a useful exercise – might as well keep it as a personal asset. You're immortalised in my GitHub now.

**Repository:** https://github.com/danielschlieder-cs/PhilStollery

Consider the additional versions a demonstration, not a deviation from the brief. Take what's useful, ignore the rest.

Happy to discuss my approach.

Daniel
